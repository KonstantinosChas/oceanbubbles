# oceanbubbles
This is a series of computer vision scripts that analyse data obtained from oceanic iamges under breaking waves. 
Input are high speed images of oceanic bubbles in freshwater, saltwater, or both.  
Output of bubble detection.m is radii and positions of bubbles in each image.
This is used as input in bubble_spacetime analysis.m to obtain bubble size statistics and meta data of bubble information.
This is used as input in bubble fresh_salt_comp.m to obtain more advanced statistics, meta-analysis of bubble output and plots. 

Note: bubble detection can be used to detect circular/close to circular objects other than bubbles on different images, or non-oceanic bubbles, droplets, sediment, soil etc. 
Or for industrial purposes.
